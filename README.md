# Weather App

![screenshot](src/assets/screenshot.png)

In this project I:

- Used Javascript to build a webpage using webpack and a [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/).

# What it does

- When the page loads, you can search for your city's ZIP code and it will show you the current weather.

## Built with

- Javascript
- HTML
- SCSS
- Webpack

## Live Demo

## Getting Started

- Clone the project to your local machine;
- `cd` into the project directory;
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary modules;
- Run `npm start`, the page will automatically load on [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).
